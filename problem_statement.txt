Problem Statement:
Predict Sleep Quality Score Based on Daily Routine

ML Algorithm: Linear Regression
Domain: Health & Wellness

Create a linear regression model that predicts a person's sleep quality score (1–10) based on their lifestyle.
Use a Google Form to collect:
- Daily screen time
- Number of meals
- Bedtime and wake-up time
